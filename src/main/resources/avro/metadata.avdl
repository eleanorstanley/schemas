This protocol defines metadata used in the other GA4GH protocols.

[Eagle: add text here from the README? Better than nothing?
The Metadata Task Team (MTT) concerns itself with data structures, attribute
and values used to describe *everything but the sequence*.  This includes
metadata for individuals, samples, analyses, instrumentation a well as
ontology representations for metadata. Naturally, the group interacts
heavily with members of most other task teams and working groups.
